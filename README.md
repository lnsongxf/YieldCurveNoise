# YieldCurveNoise
Public code for "Estimating yield curve noise."


# About
A starting point to reading the code is quantlib.ps1 which is a command line interface generate run model estimates. A majority of the remaining code is for data cleaning.

This code also requires a modified version of [Quantlib](https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib|quantlib) implementing an improved Nelson-Siegel algorithm. Releasing the modifications to that library is in progress.
